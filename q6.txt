1. The changes made in increment_int_a don't change the variable a after the function call
2. The changes made in increment_int_a do change the variable b after the function call
3. They are different because in Python integers are immutable so changing them inside a function does not change the value of the variable. But, dictionaries are mutable so changing them inside the function does affect the original variable.
